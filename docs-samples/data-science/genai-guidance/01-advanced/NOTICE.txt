## Teams Channel Fictional Conversations
This is a synthetically generated data for demonstrating how to process conversational data from Microsoft GraphAPI at scale and extract insights, such as automatically build a FAQ for discussion forums, without exposing any production data from your company's M365. 

**LLM endpoint**: Azure OpenAI GPT4o

**Platform**: Microsoft Fabric

**Approach**: we start with a set of N themes (human-defined); with LLM, generate a set of M questions randomly picking one of N themes at each iteration; for each question, generate a discussion thread.  

**Themes**: "Chemistry", "Hiking", "Cooking", "Watercolor", "Leadership", "Reading", and"Education"

**Structure**: Microsoft Graph API (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-messaging-overview)

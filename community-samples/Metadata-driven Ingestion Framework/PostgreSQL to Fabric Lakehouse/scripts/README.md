## PostgreSQL Scripts

This folder contains starter scripts to populate some dummy data in your PostgreSQL DB, if you don't already have a PostgreSQL DB with source data set up. This should be used in Level-Up skilling or for demos only.

### PostgreSQL Full Load Script

The PostgreSQL full load script is used to populate dummy data in an empty PostgreSQL DB. Run this script before running a full load pipeline. 

### PostgreSQL Incremental Load Script

The PostgreSQL incremental load script is used to extend the previously populated table by two more rows, simulating data being added to the db. Run this script before running an incremental load pipeline.
